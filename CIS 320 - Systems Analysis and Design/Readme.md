Introduces the fundamentals of object-oriented analysis and design, including experience with a CASE tool.  Topics include requirements determination, feasibility analysis, modeling with Unified Modeling Language (UML) and data dictionary construction, data modeling and normalization, user interface requirements specification, and information security procedures.  Successful completion of this course requires development of problem and design specifications for an information systems project.  Project will be a community based activity for a not-for-profit (NSF) client from the Louisville community, and will result in a completed systems design specification plan for that NSF client. This plan includes all the design elements described in the earlier part of this course description, and will be handed off to a subsequent class for final execution and deployment in client site. This course develops team skills, written and oral communication skills.
