Purpose: This assignment explores the use of parallel arrays and range matching.


This assignment asks you to re-solve Program 2 using parallel arrays and range matching (as in the Chapter 7 PowerPoint supplementary slides) to perform the decision making for the selection of registration time. Use your instructor's solution to Program 2 Version 3 as your starting point. Keep the rest of the decision logic for assigning the registration date the same. Remember, Program 2 asked you to create a Windows Forms GUI application that will determine the earliest time that a continuing UofL undergraduate student may register for Spring 2017 courses using the priority registration schedule available from the Registrar's site: Spring 2017 Priority Registration Schedule for Continuing Students.
