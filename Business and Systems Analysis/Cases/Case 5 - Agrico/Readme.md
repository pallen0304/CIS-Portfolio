This case was a matter of ethics.

Agrico had a poor relationship with AMR Consulting, a software consulting company, and one of their employees had accidentally made the source code of their management software package available to Agrico.

The resolution as I determined was to assume the worst will happen if they steal the source code, that AMR Consulting will discover that action and take Agrico to court with their contract in hand. The conclusion others received was to risk it. The future of the company may depend on it. But in my opinion, more assumptions of only positive outcomes versus the assumption of at least one negative outcome favors playing it safe.
