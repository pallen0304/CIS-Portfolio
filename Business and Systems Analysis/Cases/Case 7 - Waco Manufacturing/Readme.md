This case touched on People, and used Occam's razor, a principle from philosophy that means to make the simpler decision, the one that makes the fewest assumptions.

Waco Manufacturing is a leading supplier of custom-machined parts for the automotive industry.

The issue discussed was that an employee lied, clearly, to their manager. The problem with this, how to deal with this employee, was that a tracking system was used to prove that the employee lied, and the employees didn't know that it kept a record of where they had been and when. If the company acted on this system, other employees would become distrustful of the company and would 'vote with their feet' and leave.

Since this employee's lies were not actionable without major consequences, the resolution is to fire the employee the next time they screw up. A possible inclusion to this resolution would be to announce the history function of the tracking system as a new feature. Employees would be unhappy about this, but it would make future issues more immediately actionable.
