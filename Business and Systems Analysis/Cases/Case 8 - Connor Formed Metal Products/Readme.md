This case touched on the Four Stage Model of Technology Assimilation.

Connor Formed Metal Products is a small custom metal spring and stampings manufacturer.

The issue discussed with Connor Formed Metal Products is how to go about implementing technology, that was successful at one manufacturing plant, at other plants.

The resolution of the case was to give control over the decision to those who would know how to make the decision best, the plant managers. The plant managers would have the option to veto the technology if they did not believe it diminished any limitations. Otherwise, emphasis in voluntariness of use and demonstration of how it could make the plant and its employees more successful was advised.
