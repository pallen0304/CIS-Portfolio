The courses at UofL provided me with a solid and practical foundation for the design and implementation of database systems. Emphasis on this topic was placed on the relational database model, with significant coverage of basic relational database concepts, normalization, E-R modeling, and SQL. Additional topics included data warehouse, fundamental transaction management concepts, and more recent data storage technologies. Software used in these courses include Microsoft Visio and SQL Server Management Studio. 

Main features of the course are:

- A hands-on approach to database design, implementation, and use.

- Detailed coverage of E-R modeling as the basis for database design.

- Extensive coverage of the relational model, normalization, and SQL

- Coverage of current topics such as big data.

- Coverage of the database life cycle as an integral part of the systems development life cycle.

- Introduction to transaction management and distributed database management


In this folder are samples of entity relationship diagrams, SQL scripts, and the results of analysis done on database schemas and business scenarios.
The database related to the SQL scripts ran is in the DB sub-directory.

Assignment 12 (A12.docx) was the response I had to an in-class speaker, Judy Nichols. Her presentation was about herself, her company, and recommendations for career development within IT. Each of her recommendations, I support strongly.
